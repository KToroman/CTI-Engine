# Compile Time Insight Engine

- Use `--gui` or `--nogui` to run with or without GUI (Default: gui).  
- Use `--load-file <path>` or `-f` to load the save file at path.  
- Use `--active <path>` or `-a` to immediately run active analysis on the Source file at path.  
  * --active is only usable with --load-file and the file provided with active has to be part of the loaded save file.
